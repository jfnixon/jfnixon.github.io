title: Self-declaring nested Ruby hashes

<div class="message">
You can pass a block to Hash.new, which will define the default return value for the hash instance.

## Self-declaring nested Ruby hashes

This insight comes from Avdi Grimm and Ruby Tapas.

When instantiating a hash, **Hash#new** takes a block. This block returns the _default value_ which is returned
when attempting to access a
non-existent key. The block is yielded to in that case, and the block''s returned value
is the value returned by the hash. Send the hash instance a **#default_proc** message, and the
return value is a Proc made from the hash''s default value block. Put those two ideas together, and you can
automatically make nested hashes as needed!

### Code

{% highlight ruby %}
// Create a hash that creates a new hash as a default value
// Use it to store config data without creating all 
// the intermediate hashes

config = Hash.new do |h,key|
  h[key] = Hash.new(&h.default_proc)
end

config[:production][:database][:adapter] = 'mysql'
config[:production][:database][:adapter] # => "mysql"
{% endhighlight %}
