Complex systems evolve from working, simple systems

## Working Systems

In the 1975 book "Systematics" John Gall observed

>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system
>that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched
>up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

I think this is eactly correct. Complex systems
must be built on top of robust and well designed
infrastructure.
