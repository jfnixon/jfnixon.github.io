Hi, I'm John F. Nixon. Originally I was a physics major who found working with computers
strangely compelling. I've studied several different areas of
Computer Science, from operating systems to networking. Out in the work world, I've been a
developer, manager, VP of Engineering, professor, and a consultant. I've used my intellect
and technical chops to make great products for everything from embedded
handheld systems to national ISP datacenters. As a manager and professor, I've
used my communication skills to explain complex ideas to non-specialists in an
understandable and convincing manner.
