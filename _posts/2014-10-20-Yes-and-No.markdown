Avdi Grimm's take on the power of Yes and No
</div>

## The power of words

This post is a little different. [Avdi Grimm](http://about.avdi.org) is a smart guy. If you are learning
to be a Rubyist, you could do worse than to subscribe to his [Ruby Tapas](http://www.rubytapas.com/)
screencast episodes.

I was really impressed with his [journal entry](http://journal.avdi.org/2014/10/19/yes-and-no/). Read
the whole thing!

>Showing up is, in my mind, a form of saying “yes”. When you’re trying to change
>your circumstances, saying “yes” plays an amazingly big role.

>Yes to the open-mic night. Yes to the call for proposals. Yes to the meetup
>invite. Yes to the last-minute speaker slot that opens up, no matter how much
>of a hassle it is to change your plans. Yes to the audition. Yes to the local
>community organizer who is looking for some help. Yes to the OSS project that
>needs a new maintainer.

>This isn’t some airheaded yes-to-the-universe new age woo-woo. All of these
>“yeses” involve doing some legwork first. You have to be in the right place to
>hear the question. You have to do a little research, be on the right mailing
>lists, follow the right people. Fortunately, the Internet makes this part
>relatively easy, assuming you have access.
