Hi, I'm John F. Nixon, I'm a physics major who found working with computers
strangely compelling, and I've spent time in several different areas of
Computer Science. Developer, manager, VP, consultant, I've used my intellect
and technical chops to make great products for everything from embedded
handheld systems to national ISP datacenters. As a manager and professor, I've
used my communication skills to explain complex ideas to non-specialists in an
understandable and convincing manner.
