Binstubs are wrapper scripts to set the proper environment for executables

## Ruby tools correspond to activated gems

Ruby tools like *rake*, and *rails*, and even *gem* itself interact with the RubyGem environment. These
tools ought to be thought of as **activated gems**. We've seen that Bundler puts a lot of effort into 
selecting a set of activated gems for a project, and the various tools are part of that as well. For example,
you wouldn't want to run the wrong version of rails if your project has dependencies on the version of rails.
Rather than directly load a ruby project executable, a *binary stub* or binstub is invoked first, and it makes
sure the proper version of the executable is run and the proper set of gems is activated.

## bundle exec

Bundler understands the proper set of gems that should be activated based on the local Gemfile, so to insure
the proper version of rake, rails, thor, and so forth are run, Bundler provides the **bundle exec** command
to activate the Gemfile specified set of gems consistent with the Gemfmile's project. So invoking rails by
typing *bundle exec rails* insures the correct version of rails is run in the context of the proper set
of activated gems.

There are several tools to help avoid the need to type *bundle exec*, but I'm not altogether happy with
any of them.

## rbenv 'shims' are binstubs

The Ruby version manager **rbenv** uses binstubs to ensure the proper Ruby version is run. These binstubs
are called *shims* in rbenv-speak, and the are (usually) found in $HOME/.rbenv/shims. This directory
should be found early in the shell's $PATH. Stevphenson has a 
[really excellent explanation of binstubs](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs)
as part of rbenv's documentation.

## RubyGems also creates binstubs

Rubygems can create binstubs for gems that contain executables so the proper execution environment is set up
before the gem's executable is invoked. The latest version of a gem is the one
whose executable will be invoked if no version info is supplied to the binstub. If your project needs
to use an earlier version of a commandline tool, supply the needed version info surrounded by underscore
characters in the call to the binstub.

{% highlight shell-session %}
% rake \_1.5.2\_
{% endhighlight %}

The binstub looks like this

{% highlight ruby %}

{% endhighlight %}

Rubygems newest versions are becoming aware of the Gemfile, just like Bundler, and I think we'll
soon see the need to use *bundle exec* go away.
