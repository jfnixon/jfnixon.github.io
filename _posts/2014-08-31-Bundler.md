Managing the dependencies between RubyGems using Bundler.
</div>

## Bundler is a package dependency manager

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the correct versions of
gems needed for a project. Bundler manages the inter-gem dependencies, and selects the best set of gems that meet the version
requirements specified in a project's [Gemfile](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html). The Gemfile specifies not only the names and version
requirements for a project, but also the location of public and private gem servers.

For a single project, it doesn't really matter where Bundler stores the gems downloaded during processing of the Gemfile. But multiple
projects on a single machine might have conflicting gem requirements. There are a couple of philosophies for managing the gems needed 
across multiple projects.
